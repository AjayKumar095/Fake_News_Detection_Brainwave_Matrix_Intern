# Fake News Classification Project

## Overview
This project is designed to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using various machine learning models. The dataset is processed using **TF-IDF** vectorization, and multiple models including **Na√Øve Bayes (NB)**, **Random Forest (RF)**, and **Logistic Regression (LR)** are trained. The best model is selected based on performance metrics.

The project includes:
- **Custom ETL Pipeline**: Data cleaning, preprocessing (lemmatization & stopword removal using NLTK).
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Comparing multiple models to choose the best.
- **Flask-based Web Interface**: User-friendly UI for news classification.
- **Custom Logger**: Logging for debugging and tracking the process.

## Dataset
- Download the dataset from below link and place the dataset file in Artifacts/Dataset folder and make changes in file path name in utils/constant.py file if needed.
